Do you really think you're clever? Do you really think that you've 1-up'd me somehow? Woah, haha!! 
You sure showed me what time it is, hiding behind a screen in your damp, dark little room in the basement with your Loli fuck-pillows and piss bottles. 
You sure took the wind out of my sails the moment you shared my profile picture for you and your friends to have a sneaky giggle at. 
Well, we'll see if your buddies on Weebchan will still be laughing when I'm thumbing your fucking eyes in on LiveLeak in ULTRA-HD 14K QUALITY. 
Keep thinking you're a BIG MEMER, see what happens, because one of these days you'll meme with someone a little more local and they'll find out who/where you are. 
Enjoy your day, you pathetic, snivelling asspie.

P.S. Your memes are shit, kiddo :^ )
